### This is a test based on the following Youtube Electron Tutorial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnXz_nnQZrw

### This tutorial is created on 2020-5-27. It seems a lot of things have changed since then. And the code in the original video can not work properly now. I have to changed the code a little bit to achieve the same result in the Video.

### I didn't not apply the IPC in my code as in the Video did. I will try to learn that in the future.
